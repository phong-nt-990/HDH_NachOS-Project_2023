# NachOS Project
## My team
This is our course work for Operating System - CSC10007, at HCMUS.
  
Our team consists of:
- 21120205 - [Nguyễn Tạ Bảo](https://github.com/tabaochoke).
- 21120463 - [Lê Hữu Hưng](https://github.com/lhhmmiii).
- 21120527 - [Nguyễn Thế Phong](https://github.com/phong-nt-990).
## Requirements
- NachOS version: 4.0
- Ubuntu 18.04 (highly recommended)
- Mostly be completely built beforehand, using environment setup. You can read the instructions at link [HCMUS NachOS Instruction](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~ntquan/os/setup_nachos.html) (believe me, you don't want to read it).
- If you want to test any syscall or function in our project, copy only `code` folder to your project (it had been built completely before)

## Installation
Read instruction here: [HCMUS NachOS Instruction](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~ntquan/os/setup_nachos.html)
